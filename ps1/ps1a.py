# Problem 1
def load_cows(filename):
  """
  Read the contents of the given file.  Assumes the file contents contain
  data in the form of comma-separated cow name, weight pairs, and return a
  dictionary containing cow names as keys and corresponding weights as values.

  Parameters:
  filename - the name of the data file as a string

  Returns:
  a dictionary of cow name (string), weight (int) pairs

# Problem 2
def greedy_cow_transport(cows,limit=10):
  """
  Uses a greedy heuristic to determine an allocation of cows that attempts to
  minimize the number of spaceship trips needed to transport all the cows. The
  returned allocation of cows may or may not be optimal.
  The greedy heuristic should follow the following method:

  1. As long as the current trip can fit another cow, add the largest cow that will fit
      to the trip
  2. Once the trip is full, begin a new trip to transport the remaining cows

  Does not mutate the given dictionary of cows.

  Parameters:
  cows - a dictionary of name (string), weight (int) pairs
  limit - weight limit of the spaceship (an int)
  
  Returns:
  A list of lists, with each inner list containing the names of cows
  transported on a particular trip and the overall list containing all the
  trips

# Problem 3
def brute_force_cow_transport(cows,limit=10):
  """
  Finds the allocation of cows that minimizes the number of spaceship trips
  via brute force.  The brute force algorithm should follow the following method:

  1. Enumerate all possible ways that the cows can be divided into separate trips 
      Use the given get_partitions function in ps1_partition.py to help you!
  2. Select the allocation that minimizes the number of trips without making any trip
      that does not obey the weight limitation
          
  Does not mutate the given dictionary of cows.

  Parameters:
  cows - a dictionary of name (string), weight (int) pairs
  limit - weight limit of the spaceship (an int)

  transported on a particular trip and the overall list containing all the
