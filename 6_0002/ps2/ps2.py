# Problem 2: Building up the Campus Map
#
# Problem 2a: Designing your graph
#
# What do the graph's nodes represent in this problem? What
# do the graph's edges represent? Where are the distances
# represented?
#
# Answer: Nodes represent buildings. Edges paths between two buildings. 
# Weights represent distances between the two buildings.

#
# Problem 3: Finding the Shorest Path using Optimized Search Method
#
# Problem 3a: Objective function
#
# What is the objective function for this problem? What are the constraints?
#
# Answer: obtain shortest total distance between two nodes by 
# traversing edges, while not exceeding the outdoor distance limit
# Learning Experience: the list method .copy() does create a element by element copy of the list
# however; if one element of the list is a refernce object, such as another list that reference object is 
# only a shallow copy. Therfore the deepcopy() method from the copy library is used to copy all elements of the
# path list.
