Monte Carlo simulation was invented by Polish American mathematician Stanislaw
Ulam. Probably more well known for his work on thermonuclear weapons than on
mathematics. 
The story goes Ulam was recovering from illness and was at home bored playing a
lot of games of solitare. And wondered the mathematical probability of winning
a game.
He relized he would have to play thousands of games to mathematicaly infer this
information. So instead he got a friend (John von Neumann) with a computer (a
fancy new ENIAC) to simulation the game for a few hours of compute time.
This was the first known Monte Carlo Simulation.

The mathematical theory is to take a proper sample of the entire population. If
the sample is large enough, the sample should exhbit the same (or close enough)
characteristics to the actual population.

As the varience grows, we need larger samples to have the same amount of
confidence.

A gambler's falicy:
Probability of 26 consecutive reds: 1/67,108,865
Probability of 26 consecurive reds when the previous 25 rolls were red: 1/2

Now, there is something that is not a gambler's falicy called regression to the
mean. Basically, if both parents are taller than average it's likely that the
child will be shorter than the parents. If both parents are shorter than
average the child will likly be taller than the parents. This is statistically
true even though the whole genetics part of this study is ignored.

Likely that next even will be less extreme. It will likely be closer to the
mean. Likely to return to mean because it's independent.
