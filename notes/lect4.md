#Lecture 4. Stochastic Thinking
Copenhagen Doctrine (Bohr and Heisenberg)
At it's most fundamental level, the behavior of the world can not be predicted.
We can agree "X is highly likely to occur" but not "X is certain to occur"

###Does it really matter?
What happens happens.
We will never have complete knowlege of the world, therefore we might as well treat it as non-deterministic.
This is predictive nondeterminism.

###Stochastic Processes
Any ongoing process in which the next state depends on the previous state with some random element.
Import the librarry called random

Probability always range from 0 to 1.
Probability of an event happening is p. Then probability of it not happening is 1 - p.

###Sample probability vs. Actual Probability
* Sample probability is taken from a number of trials 
* Actual probability is the real unmeasureable probability
* Sample probability approaoches Actual probability as number of trials approaches infinity
